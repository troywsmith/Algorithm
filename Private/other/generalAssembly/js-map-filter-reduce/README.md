isDivisibleBy3 – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of booleans indicating whether each element is divisible by 3

ex: isDivisibleBy3([1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]) => [false, true, false, true, false, false true]
.filter() link
Write code using .filter() to have the following input and output:

getOdds – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of only odd numbers

ex: getOdds([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
getEvens – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of only even numbers

ex: getEvens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
getDivisibleBy4 – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of only numbers that are divisible by 4

ex: getDivisibleBy4([1, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13]) => [4, 8, 12]
.reduce() link
Write code using .reduce() to have the following input and output:

addUpAll – add up all numbers in a given array

ex. addUpAll([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => 55
multiplyAllNums – multiply all numbers in a given array

ex. multiplyAllNums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) => 120
squareAllNums – power up all numbers in a given array

ex. squareAllNums([3, 2, 3]) => 729, bc (3 ^ 2) = 9, and (9 ^ 3) = 729
addUpAllAges – add up all the ages in an array of objects

ex. addUpAllAges([{name: 'Carl', age: 30}, {name: 'Cara', age: 10}, {name: 'Carmen', age: 15}]) => 55
