"""
Model View Controller Pattern
- Most commonly used pattern
- easy to implement

Model:
- consists of pure application logic, which interacts w/ db
- includes all info to represent data to end user

View:
- HTML files, which interact w/ end user
- represents the model's data to user

Controller:
- acts as an intermediary between view and model
- listens to the events triggered by view and queries 
model for the same
